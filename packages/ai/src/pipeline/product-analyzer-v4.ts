The teal creates maximum complementary contrast against warm embroidery tones (gold, red, orange). A dramatic shadow of the garment cast on the teal surface adds a second compositional element. Bold, elegant, dynamic.`,
      `TERRACOTTA STYLED. Techniques: WARM TERRACOTTA BACKDROP + COMPLEMENTARY ACCESSORY + HARD KEY LIGHT. Warm terracotta seamless paper. The garment displayed with one complementary accessory — a pair of jhumka earrings, mojari shoes, or a clutch — placed at the base. Hard key light from 45° left creating clean, defined shadows on the warm surface. The terracotta warmth enhances rich fabric colors. Styled, intentional, campaign-ready.`,
      `SAGE TEXTURE. Techniques: SAGE GREEN BACKDROP + TEXTURE-REVEALING SIDE LIGHT + DETAIL FOCUS. Sage green seamless paper. Strong side light from the right specifically angled to reveal fabric texture — weave pattern, embroidery relief, thread detail, print depth. The sage green provides a calm, sophisticated neutral that lets the garment's texture be the hero. Close enough framing to see individual threads catching light.`,
      `ROSE MINIMAL. Techniques: DUSTY ROSE BACKDROP + MINIMAL STYLING + SOFT DIRECTIONAL LIGHT. Dusty rose seamless paper. The garment displayed cleanly with zero props — the fabric itself is the entire story. Soft directional studio light from front-left creating gentle shadow transitions that reveal the garment's drape and silhouette. The rose backdrop adds warmth without competing. Minimal, feminine, elegant.`,
      `NAVY METALLIC. Techniques: NAVY BACKDROP + METALLIC ACCESSORY ACCENT + DRAMATIC RIM LIGHTING. Deep navy seamless paper. The garment accented with a metallic accessory — gold belt, silver brooch, or brass buttons catching a hard rim light. The navy backdrop makes metallic elements sparkle dramatically. Rim light from behind separates the garment from the dark background. Bold, editorial, high-fashion energy.`,

    electronics: [
      `MATTE BLACK NEON. Techniques: MATTE BLACK BACKDROP + NEON BLUE ACCENT RIM LIGHT + REFLECTIVE SURFACE. Matte black seamless paper. Product on a dark reflective surface showing a subtle mirror image below. A neon blue accent rim light from behind-right creates a striking electric blue edge on the product. The futuristic glow against total darkness makes the product look like it belongs in 2030. Sleek, powerful, cutting-edge.`,
      `CHARCOAL FOG. Techniques: DEEP CHARCOAL BACKDROP + COOL CYAN EDGE GLOW + BASE FOG. Deep charcoal seamless paper. Product elevated slightly with cool cyan LED edge glow wrapping around its silhouette from behind. Low-lying fog rolling across the base, caught in the cyan light. The product emerges from the mist like technology materializing. Mysterious, premium, futuristic.`,
      `NAVY SCREEN. Techniques: DARK NAVY BACKDROP + PURPLE ACCENT LIGHTING + PRODUCT SCREEN GLOW. Dark navy seamless paper. If the product has a screen, its glow illuminates the immediate surroundings. Purple accent light from one side creates a violet wash on the product edges. The navy-purple color story feels premium tech. For non-screen products, the purple accent IS the glow source. Immersive, tech-forward, cinematic.`,
      `CONCRETE SPLIT. Techniques: CONCRETE GREY BACKDROP + WARM-COOL SPLIT LIGHTING + MINIMAL STYLING. Concrete grey seamless paper with visible texture. Warm light from the left, cool light from the right — split lighting creating chromatic contrast across the product surface. Zero props — the product and the light are the entire composition. Industrial, honest, design-focused.`,
      `VOID RGB. Techniques: PURE BLACK BACKDROP + RGB COLORED RIM LIGHTS + FLOATING PARTICLES. Pure black seamless paper. Three colored rim lights — red, green, blue — positioned at different angles creating an RGB color separation effect on the product edges. Fine floating particles caught in the colored beams. The product looks like a hero reveal in a gaming trailer. Bold, vibrant, electrifying.`,

      `TERRACOTTA TRAVEL. Techniques: WARM TERRACOTTA BACKDROP + TRAVEL ACCESSORIES + GOLDEN KEY LIGHT. Warm terracotta seamless paper. The bag with travel accessories casually peeking out — a passport corner, sunglasses arm, a map fold. Golden key light from front-left at 3800K creating warm shadows on the terracotta surface. The warm tones evoke adventure and wanderlust. Aspirational, curated, journey-ready.`,
      `SAGE LEATHER. Techniques: SAGE GREEN BACKDROP + LEATHER TEXTURE HIGHLIGHT + WARM SIDE LIGHT. Sage green seamless paper. Strong warm side light from the right specifically angled to reveal the bag's leather grain, stitch detail, and surface patina. The sage green provides an earthy, sophisticated contrast. The bag's craftsmanship is the hero — every stitch visible. Artisanal, quality-focused, tactile.`,
      `NAVY HARDWARE. Techniques: NAVY BACKDROP + METALLIC HARDWARE SPARKLE + HARD DIRECTIONAL LIGHT. Deep navy seamless paper. Hard directional light from above-left creating intense specular highlights on every metallic element — zippers, buckles, clasps, rivets, chain links. The navy darkness makes the metal glow like jewelry. The bag looks expensive, the hardware looks precious. Premium, detail-obsessed, luxurious.`,
      `PINK EDITORIAL. Techniques: DUSTY PINK BACKDROP + FASHION MAGAZINE PROP + STUDIO RIM LIGHT. Dusty pink seamless paper. The bag placed beside an open fashion magazine (blurred pages) and a pair of sunglasses as styling props. Studio rim light from behind creating edge separation. The pink backdrop creates a feminine, editorial fashion shoot feel. Stylish, curated, magazine-worthy.`,
      `CHARCOAL SHADOW. Techniques: CHARCOAL BACKDROP + DRAMATIC SHADOW PLAY + SINGLE OVERHEAD SPOT. Dark charcoal seamless paper. Single overhead spot creating a focused cone of light on the bag with a dramatic, elongated shadow stretching across the dark surface. Minimal styling — the bag and its shadow are the entire composition. The shadow adds visual weight and drama. Architectural, bold, statement-making.`,

    default: [
      `TEAL CAMPAIGN. Techniques: DEEP TEAL BACKDROP + COMPLEMENTARY PROP + HARD KEY LIGHT. Deep teal seamless paper creating maximum contrast with the product. One complementary prop at the base telling the product's story. Hard key light from 45° left creating a dramatic shadow cast on the teal surface. The cool teal makes warm product tones pop. Bold, professional, campaign-ready.`,
      `TERRACOTTA WARMTH. Techniques: WARM TERRACOTTA BACKDROP + NATURAL TEXTURE ACCENT + GOLDEN SIDE LIGHT. Warm terracotta/clay seamless paper. A natural texture accent near the base — a linen fold, a wooden element, a ceramic piece. Golden side light from the right at 3800K creating warm dimensional shadows. The earthy tones communicate authenticity and craft. Warm, grounded, artisanal.`,
      `SAGE STUDIO. Techniques: DUSTY SAGE BACKDROP + SINGLE CONTEXTUAL PROP + SOFT DIRECTIONAL LIGHT. Dusty sage green seamless paper. One single contextual prop that relates to the product's use or story. Soft directional studio light from front-left creating gentle, clean shadows. The muted green provides a calm, sophisticated canvas. Refined, intentional, modern.`,
      `NAVY ACCENT. Techniques: RICH NAVY BACKDROP + METALLIC ACCENT ELEMENT + DUAL STUDIO LIGHTING. Rich navy seamless paper. A small metallic accent element — brass dish, copper tray, gold-toned object — beside the product. Dual studio lighting: warm key from left, cool fill from right creating chromatic depth. The navy-metallic combination feels premium and editorial. Elevated, luxurious, polished.`,
      `BLUSH SHADOW. Techniques: WARM BLUSH BACKDROP + MINIMAL STYLING + DRAMATIC SHADOW PLAY. Warm blush/salmon seamless paper. Zero props — the product stands alone. Hard studio light creating a dramatic shadow of the product stretching across the blush surface. The shadow becomes the primary compositional element. The warmth of the blush adds approachability to the drama. Clean, bold, graphic.`,

      `GALLERY PEDESTAL. The jewellery centered on a white marble cube pedestal against a pale grey wall. Single hard overhead light creates a perfect circular pool of illumination. The shadow of the jewellery on the marble is as precise as the jewellery itself.`,
      `NEGATIVE SPACE STUDY. The jewellery placed at the bottom-right intersection of a rule-of-thirds grid. 70% of the frame is smooth dove grey. One directional light from the left. The emptiness amplifies the preciousness of the object.`,

      `ARCHITECTURAL STILLNESS. Techniques: SINGLE DIRECTIONAL LIGHT + DRAMATIC SHADOW + NEGATIVE SPACE. One hard light source from 60-80° creating a long, geometric shadow that IS the primary compositional element — the shadow is as important as the product itself. Product on raw concrete or honed stone. 60-70% of the frame is intentional empty space creating visual tension. Rule-of-thirds placement at the intersection. NO props, NO people, NO hands. The interplay of form, shadow, and void creates an architectural meditation. Zen, sophisticated, gallery-worthy.`,
      `LEVITATION STUDY. Product floats in infinite white void with only a soft contact shadow beneath. Dead center placement. The emptiness IS the composition. Zero props, zero surface texture.`,
      `COLOR FIELD. Product on a single muted-color surface (warm grey, pale sage, or dusty blush). Hard overhead light creates a tight illumination pool with sharp shadow edges. Product at bottom-third, 65% empty color field above.`,

    style_festive: `INDIAN FESTIVE — FESTIVAL-AWARE CELEBRATION

Current month: ${new Date().toLocaleString('en-US', { month: 'long' })}

Select the festival context that BEST matches THIS product and the current season:

- DIWALI (Oct-Nov): Lit diyas, rangoli, marigolds, gold+saffron palette. For gifts, candles, sweets, home decor.
- HOLI (March): Colored powders (gulal), playful energy, bright colors against white. For colorful/playful products.
- NAVRATRI (Sep-Oct): Dandiya sticks, garba dress fabric, nine vibrant colors. For fashion/garments.
- EID (varies): Crescent moon, brass lanterns, dates, green+white+gold. For perfume, fashion, food.
- CHRISTMAS (Dec): Pine branches, red+green+gold ornaments, gift boxes, fairy lights. For gifts, food.
- RAKSHA BANDHAN (Aug): Decorative rakhi, brass thali, sweets. For sibling gifts.
- ONAM (Aug-Sep): Pookalam flowers, banana leaf, Kerala brass lamp. For South Indian products.
- PONGAL (Jan): Sugarcane, kolam pattern, harvest pots. For food/harvest products.
- GENERIC FESTIVE: When no specific festival fits. Warm golden light, celebration elements, brass accents.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Do NOT default to Diwali for everything. Each festival has COMPLETELY different visual elements.
- Do NOT mix festivals — no Diwali diyas with Holi colors or Eid props with Christmas trees.
- Match the festival to the product's natural occasion. A garment → Navratri fashion. A candle → Diwali lights. A food product → feast/harvest context.
- Warm golden lighting (2700-3500K) dominates. Festival elements are supporting cast — the product is ALWAYS the hero.
- NO modern/gym/office settings. Props should be relevant to the product and follow best advertising practices for the product category.

Anti-patterns:
- Diyas are ONLY for Diwali/Hindu festivals
- Marigolds are ONLY for Diwali/Pooja contexts
- Do NOT use "red silk + brass thali" for everything`,

Select the dark luxury sub-style that BEST matches THIS product:

- NOIR EDITORIAL: For luxury/premium items (perfume, watches, bags). Hard shadow from extreme angle, half the product consumed by shadow, film noir mystery. Dark stone or concrete surface.
- SPOTLIGHT ISOLATION: For precious small objects (jewellery, rings, collectibles). Single tight overhead spotlight, absolute void outside the cone. Product floats in its own theater.
- WET OBSIDIAN: For cold beverages, skincare bottles, glass containers. Polished reflective black surface, condensation beads, mirror reflection below.
- SMOKE AND EMBER: For candles, incense, spices, hot beverages. Rising smoke/steam caught in warm amber underlighting. Dark marble surface.
- NEON ACCENT: For electronics, tech accessories, gaming gear, energy drinks. Matte black with single colored rim light (cyan, blue, or brand-color-matched).
- INGREDIENT EXPLOSION: For food/snacks with visible ingredients. Frozen burst of ingredients outward from product, dual rim lights, polished black acrylic reflection.
- CHROMATIC SPLIT: For fashion, garments, dual-nature products. Two contrasting colored lights from opposite sides creating split lighting.

CRITICAL: Each product type gets a DIFFERENT dark treatment. A candle is NOT lit the same as a perfume. A protein bar is NOT displayed like jewellery. Select the sub-style that creates the most compelling dark ad for THIS specific product.
NO bright/outdoor/festive settings. Props should be relevant to the product and follow best advertising practices for the product category.

Anti-patterns:
- Do NOT put every product on the same polished black acrylic with rim lighting
- Do NOT use mist/fog as the default — match dynamic element to the product
- Do NOT use the same surface for all products

CRITICAL CREATIVE RULES FOR DARK LUXURY:
1. The product must be CLEARLY VISIBLE — use strong rim light, edge light, or spotlight to separate it from darkness. The product should GLOW.
2. Dark luxury is NOT "product on black background" — it's a CINEMATIC SCENE with depth, atmosphere, and visual energy.
3. Include at least ONE element that creates DEPTH: a reflection below, smoke behind, particles in light, a gradient surface, textured material.
4. The lighting should tell a STORY — dramatic hard light from one direction creates mystery. Dual rim lights create premium editorial feel. Spotlight creates reverence.
5. The background should have SUBTLE variation — not flat black. Use deep navy, dark charcoal, or gradient transitions. Pure flat black looks cheap.
6. Color accent is POWERFUL in darkness — a single warm amber accent, or a cool cyan edge, or the product's own colors catching light creates scroll-stopping contrast.
7. The hero moment for dark luxury is the INTERPLAY between light and shadow on the product surface — how light catches the material, reveals texture, creates specular highlights.`,
    style_outdoor: 'NATURAL OUTDOOR: Golden-hour natural light, organic textures (wood, stone, leaves), real outdoor environment. NO studio/indoor settings. Props should be relevant to the product and follow best advertising practices for the product category.',
    style_lifestyle: 'LIFESTYLE SETTING: Warm home/cafe/workspace environment, natural light, lived-in feel with contextual props. Aspirational but relatable. Props should be relevant to the product and follow best advertising practices for the product category.',
    style_studio: `COLORED STUDIO: Clean colored backdrop — NEVER white or grey. Choose a SPECIFIC, BOLD color:
- For warm-toned products (gold, red, orange, brown): use cool backdrops (teal, navy, sage green, slate blue)
- For cool-toned products (blue, silver, white, green): use warm backdrops (terracotta, dusty rose, warm sand, burnt sienna)
- For neutral products: use bold saturated colors (deep teal, rich burgundy, emerald, royal purple)
State the EXACT color name in your creativeBrief. Professional studio lighting, product-focused.
PROPS RULE: Props are ALLOWED but ONLY if directly derived from the product — its ingredients, flavors, materials, or primary use-case. Examples: a chips bag with its flavor ingredients (chili peppers, lime slices, scattered chips), skincare with its key botanical ingredient (rose petals, aloe leaves), a coffee product with coffee beans. If nothing relevant can be derived from the product, use ZERO props. A plain water bottle = no props. A gold necklace = soft velvet fabric only. Props must enhance the product story, not distract from it.`,
    style_autmn_special: `AUTMN SPECIAL — PUSH BEYOND ALL LIMITS.
This is NOT a standard product photo. This is an AWARD-WINNING advertising campaign image.

Think like the world's most daring creative director:
- UNEXPECTED angles and compositions (not eye-level, not centered)
- DRAMATIC lighting that creates mood and emotion (not flat studio light)
- BOLD color choices that make the product EXPLODE off the screen
- ONE dynamic element that creates visual ENERGY (frozen splash, floating particles, dramatic shadow)
- The kind of image that wins Cannes Lions advertising awards

DO NOT default to "product on a table with nice lighting." That is BORING.
DO NOT create anything that looks like a standard lifestyle or outdoor shot.

Think: What would make a creative director at Ogilvy or Wieden+Kennedy say "THAT is brilliant"?

Examples of bold thinking:
- A soda bottle with an explosion of citrus and ice crystals against a pure black void with dramatic rim lighting
- A necklace draped over volcanic rock at sunset, waves crashing in background
- A skincare bottle floating in a pool of its own product, catching light like liquid gold
- A protein bar on the edge of a skyscraper ledge, city lights bokeh behind it

    style_with_model: `WITH MODEL — A PERSON AND THE PRODUCT TOGETHER

Show a person naturally interacting with this product in a way that makes someone want to buy it.

PRINCIPLES (not rules — use your creative judgment):
- The product must be clearly visible and recognizable — it is the REASON this ad exists
- A person must be visible with their face showing — not just hands or feet
- The interaction should feel NATURAL and AUTHENTIC — mid-action, not posed
- Think about what makes the BEST possible ad for THIS specific product with a person in it
- Sometimes the person USING the product is the ad. Sometimes the person's LIFESTYLE with the product is the ad. You decide which approach creates a more compelling image for THIS product.
- The person should represent the product's target audience

Show a face. Show the product. Make it look like a professional advertisement. You are a world-class creative director — figure out the best composition.`,

  "creativeBrief": "Editorial product advertisement. Against total darkness, the masala chips pack stands center-frame on wet black acrylic, its mirror reflection visible below. Two strip softbox rim lights from behind-left and behind-right create razor-sharp glowing edges on the metallic packaging. From the torn-open top, an explosion of chips, red chili powder, crushed peanuts, and curry leaves erupts outward in a frozen burst — each element suspended mid-air, lit by the rim lights. Individual chili powder particles form a red-orange cloud around the upper half of the pack. One large chip is frozen at the peak of its arc, its seasoning crystals catching individual specks of light. At the base, scattered curry leaves and peanut fragments rest on the wet black surface among the reflection. Hard key light from front-left at 45° illuminates the pack label. The acrylic surface shows authentic wet sheen. Subtle film grain. Square format, 1:1 aspect ratio."

  "creativeBrief": "Editorial product advertisement. Against pure black, the energy can stands on polished black obsidian with its reflection visible below. Behind the can, a massive crown-shaped splash of water and crushed ice erupts upward and outward, frozen at 1/8000s — individual droplets razor-sharp against the darkness. Two strip softbox rim lights: one in the can's brand accent color, one cool white, create dual-colored edges on every surface. Ice chunks and shards scatter at the base, some caught mid-bounce. The can surface is covered in beaded condensation, each droplet acting as a tiny lens. Low-lying cold mist rolls across the obsidian surface. The can label is sharply legible, illuminated by a subtle warm key from front-left. The wet surface reflects the chaos of the splash. Subtle vignetting at edges. Square format, 1:1 aspect ratio."

A dramatic shadow of the garment falls on the teal surface, creating a second compositional element. One small prop at the base: a pair of jhumka earrings.",
  "creativeBrief": "Editorial product advertisement. Against a rich deep teal seamless paper backdrop — chosen specifically because the kurti's warm gold and red embroidery creates maximum complementary contrast against the cool teal. The embroidered kurti is displayed showing its full silhouette. The fabric's bottom edge is caught mid-ripple, creating dynamic movement. Hard key light from 45° front-left at 5500K creates a dramatic shadow of the garment on the teal surface — the shadow becomes a compositional element, stretching to the right. Fill light from a reflector at 3:1 ratio preserves embroidery detail in the shadows. Each gold embroidery thread catches specular highlights, creating a constellation of tiny light points across the fabric. At the base, a pair of brass jhumka earrings provides scale and cultural context. The teal-gold contrast is the creative strategy — warm product on cool backdrop for maximum visual impact.

A single hard light from 70° left creates a long, dramatic shadow stretching diagonally across the empty concrete — the shadow is as important as the object itself. No props. No decoration. The vast empty space and the shadow create an architectural meditation.",
  "creativeBrief": "Editorial product advertisement. On a raw honed concrete surface with subtle aggregate visible, the ceramic vase sits at the right-third intersection point. A single hard directional light source from 70° left at 5000K neutral creates a long, razor-sharp geometric shadow that stretches diagonally across the concrete to the bottom-left corner — the shadow occupies more visual space than the product itself and IS the primary compositional element. 60-65% of the frame is intentional empty concrete, creating deliberate tension between object and void. The vase's curved form is rendered in clean side-lit dimension — highlight on the left face, gradual shadow transition to the right. The concrete shows micro-texture and natural variation. No props, no color accents, no distractions. The interplay of form, shadow, and negative space creates gallery-worthy stillness. Subtle film grain at full resolution.

From behind-left, a subtle cool white strip softbox provides secondary edge definition. Low-lying fog rolls across the obsidian surface at the base, the fog itself catching and diffusing the cyan light into a soft ground-level glow. The case's small LED status indicator glows warm amber, creating a tiny secondary light source that reflects in the obsidian below. Fine dust particles float in the cyan light beam, visible as tiny bright points against the void. The case surface shows authentic material texture — matte plastic with subtle sheen where the light catches. The obsidian surface has a wet, mirror-like quality.

== MANDATORY STYLE: ${styleKey} ==
Every creative field you return — heroMoment, storyScene, creativeBrief, dynamicElements — MUST match this style.

Do NOT override this style based on product type. The user chose this style explicitly.

`;

  if (isMultiImage) {
    prompt += `== MULTI-ANGLE TASKS ==

### Task A: Choose the best primary image
Examine all ${imageCount} images and identify which one is the BEST primary photo.

CRITICAL: The primary image MUST show the FRONT face of the product — the side with the brand name, logo, and product name prominently displayed. This is the face that appears on store shelves facing customers.

STRICT PRIORITY ORDER — work top to bottom:
1. FRONT/DISPLAY FACE (HIGHEST PRIORITY): Pick the image showing the FRONT of the product — the branded face, logo side, display label, the side that faces customers in a store. A nutrition facts panel, ingredient list, barcode, manufacturing date, regulatory text, or back label is ALWAYS the BACK — never select it as primary.
2. MOST BRANDING VISIBLE: Among front-facing images, prefer the one with the most visible brand name, logo, key text.
3. BEST LIGHTING: Among equally-branded images, prefer sharper, better-lit.
4. LEAST CLUTTER: Final tiebreaker — less background clutter.

FALLBACK RULE: If NO image clearly shows the front face (all images show backs, sides, or ingredient lists), choose the image that shows the MOST brand name or logo text visible. A partially visible brand name is always better than a fully visible ingredient list. NEVER select an image that primarily shows nutrition facts, ingredient lists, barcodes, manufacturing dates, or regulatory text as the primary image.

Return "primaryImageIndex" as a 0-indexed integer (0 = first image, 1 = second image, etc.).
Return "primaryImageReason" explaining briefly why this image was chosen.

### Task B: Per-angle quality assessment
For each of the ${imageCount} images (indexed 0 to ${imageCount - 1}), assess:
- "index": 0-indexed image number
- "quality": "excellent" | "good" | "usable" | "poor"
- "bestFor": what this angle reveals — e.g., "front label visibility", "shape and profile", "ingredient list"

### Task C: Reference image ranking
Rank the NON-primary images by how much unique, additive value they provide to the creative brief.
- "index": image index (not the primary)
- "valueScore": 0-10 (10 = high unique value)
- "uniqueInfo": what specific new information this angle provides

### Task D: Cross-angle insights
"crossAngleInsights": Summarize what ADDITIONAL information each non-primary angle reveals compared to the primary. E.g., "Back angle (image 2) reveals a full ingredient list and '100% natural' certification badge."

### Task E: Complete branding inventory from ALL angles
Extract EVERY piece of text visible across ALL angles into "brandingInventory":
- "text": the exact text visible
- "type": "brand_name" | "tagline" | "ingredient" | "certification" | "weight" | "barcode" | "other"
- "prominence": "dominant" (large, brand-hero text) | "secondary" (supporting) | "small_print" (fine print, regulatory)

`;
  } else {
    prompt += `Since only one image is provided:

- "primaryImageReason": brief note on the image quality
- "angleQualities": single entry for index 0
- "crossAngleInsights": "Single image provided — no cross-angle synthesis possible."
- "referenceImageRanking": empty array []
- "brandingInventory": extract all text visible in this single image

`;
  }

  prompt += `== ANALYSIS TASKS ==

## STEP 1: Input Quality Assessment
- Is this photo usable? Reject only if: no product visible, extremely blurry (<100px), corrupted.
- Accept messy backgrounds, poor lighting, bad angles — we fix everything.
- "hasGlare": true if visible specular reflections or flash hotspots on product
- "inputAngleQuality": "good" | "suboptimal" | "unusable" (assess the PRIMARY image)
- "usable": false ONLY if NO product is visible in ANY of the images, or ALL images are severely corrupted.
- "rejectionReason": explanation if usable is false, otherwise null.

## STEP 2: Product Identification (be EXTREMELY specific)
Full brand name, product type, variant, size. NOT "speaker" but "Anker SoundCore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker, black mesh front, ANKER logo on face." Synthesize details visible across ALL angles.
- "productName": Full, specific product name including brand, variant, and format.
- "brandName": Brand name or null if unbranded.
- "productType": The type of product (e.g., "face wash", "earrings", "kurti").
- "specificDescription": 2-3 sentences describing the product in detail as seen across ALL angles.
- "productComponents": List EVERY visible physical sub-component across ALL photos — caps, lids, straws, cables, stands, boxes, tags, applicators. Be exhaustive.
- "visibleText": ALL text visible across ALL angles — brand names, taglines, ingredients, certifications, barcodes.
- "isColdBeverage": true if the product is ANY beverage served cold or at room temperature — energy drink cans, soda, cola, sparkling water, juice, water bottles, beer, sports drinks, iced tea, cold coffee cans, kombucha. False for non-beverages and hot beverages. When in doubt, set true.
- "isTransparent": true if the product is transparent or semi-transparent (glass bottles, clear plastic, glass candle holders, acrylic). False for all opaque products.

## STEP 2.5: Physical Characteristics
- "productPhysicalSize": "tiny" (palm-sized) | "small" (hand-sized) | "medium" (forearm-sized) | "large" (bigger)
- "productDimensionality": "flat_2d" (cards, stickers, pouches) | "shallow_3d" (plates, slabs, thin boxes) | "deep_3d" (bottles, cans, boxes with depth)
- "recommendedCanvasFill": 0.3–0.95 (tiny+flat=0.85, large=0.60)
- "dominantColors": all colors visible across all angles
- "material": primary material(s) the product is made from
- "shape": geometric shape description
- "keyVisualElements": all notable visual elements across ALL angles
- "productCategory": "food" | "jewellery" | "garment" | "skincare" | "candle" | "bag" | "home_goods" | "electronics" | "handicraft" | "other"

## STEP 3: Branding Detection
- "hasBranding": true if ANY brand text/logo/mark visible in ANY image
- "brandingConfidence": 0.0–1.0 — when uncertain, err HIGH — better to preserve than destroy
- "brandElements": list every distinct brand element found across ALL angles

## STEP 4: Full Product Analysis
- "targetAudience": who buys this product (demographics, lifestyle, aspirations)
- "priceSegment": "budget" | "mid_range" | "premium" | "luxury"
- "desiredEmotion": the single strongest emotion this product should evoke
- "adBestPractices": 1-2 sentences on what makes ads for this product category effective

## STEP 5: CREATIVE CONCEPT (THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP)

You are now the creative director. Your job is to design an advertisement that makes people WANT this product.

### 5a: Hero Moment
What single EMOTIONAL MOMENT should this ad capture? Not "product on a nice background" but a specific human moment that triggers desire. Examples: "the first sip of ice-cold lemonade on a hot day", "the satisfaction of biting into a warm cookie", "the quiet confidence of clasping on a precious necklace."

### 5b: Dynamic Elements
What specific MOTION, TEXTURE, or ACTION elements make this ad come alive?

- VARIETY IN DYNAMIC ELEMENTS: Do NOT default to "mist" or "fog" for every style. Each style should have its own signature dynamic elements:
  - Clean White: subtle reflection/shadow ONLY — no mist, no fog, no particles
  - Studio: light play on colored surface, product shadow — no mist
  - Gradient/Dark Luxury: splashes, particles, rim-light flares — mist is OK here
  - Lifestyle: steam from coffee, crumbs, spilled ingredients — contextual to the product's USE
  - Outdoor: wind-blown elements, natural light flares, pollen — no artificial mist
  - Festive: diya smoke, floating petals, sparkles — no cold mist
  - Minimal: shadow ONLY — absolutely nothing else in the scene
  - With Model: person's natural environment — no artificial atmospheric effects

The style is FIXED as ${styleKey}. You MUST use ONLY elements that fit this style.

## CREATIVE CONCEPT — PROFESSIONAL AD CREATIVE DIRECTION

You are a world-class advertising creative director. Design the PERFECT advertisement for THIS specific product. Follow this professional decision framework:

### STEP A: Identify the product at the MOST SPECIFIC level
Not "food" but "packaged dark chocolate bar, premium, 70% cocoa"
Not "jewellery" but "kundan bridal necklace set, heavy work, traditional"
Not "skincare" but "vitamin C face serum, glass dropper bottle, orange liquid"

### STEP B: Determine the HERO MOMENT
The hero moment is the single most compelling frozen instant for THIS product:
- Honey → thick golden thread mid-pour catching backlight
- Chocolate → broken piece revealing filling, crumbs scattered
- Face serum → one golden drop mid-fall from dropper
- Bridal necklace → laid out on red silk beside lit diyas
- Craft beer → condensation beads catching golden hour light
- Candle → first flame catching, wisp of smoke rising
- Protein bar → half-unwrapped showing texture inside
- Soda → aggressive condensation, ice crystals clinging
- Chips → bag torn open, chips spilling out mid-crunch

Formula: Product + Peak Emotional State + ONE Dynamic Element

### STEP C: Select the EMOTIONAL TRIGGER
Match the PRIMARY emotion to the product:
- Craving → food, beverages, chocolate (visceral, pre-rational)
- Desire → jewellery, luxury goods, fashion (aspirational)
- Comfort → candles, home decor, night cream (safety, warmth)
- Confidence → skincare, garments, bags (self-improvement)
- Energy → energy drinks, activewear, electronics (power, dynamism)
- Freshness → sunscreen, face wash, mint products (renewal)
- Nostalgia → traditional sweets, heritage crafts, Ayurvedic (roots, authenticity)
- Sophistication → premium tea, artisanal products, leather (taste, refinement)
- Joy → party snacks, festive items, gifts (celebration)
- Warmth → chai, winter wear, handmade items (belonging, home)

### STEP D: Determine the REAL USAGE CONTEXT
Think about WHEN and WHERE this product is ACTUALLY used:

TIME OF DAY → determines lighting:
- Morning products → soft window light (4500-5500K)
- Evening products → warm lamp light (2800-3200K)
- Night products → intimate, low-key lighting

LOCATION → determines surface and background:
- Kitchen counter, bathroom vanity, gym bench, office desk
- Outdoor terrace, park, poolside, café table
- Bedroom nightstand, vanity table, dining table

SOCIAL CONTEXT:
- Alone (self-care, morning ritual)
- With partner (gifting, dinner)
- With friends (party, outing)
- With family (festival, meal)

### STEP E: Match ENVIRONMENT to PRICE SEGMENT
The scene must match the product's price point:

Budget (under Rs 200): Simple wood, colorful, busy but warm. Bright, energetic light.
Mid-range (Rs 200-1000): Natural wood, ceramic. Curated, 2-3 props. Warm, directional light.
Premium (Rs 1000-5000): Marble, brass, dark wood. Clean, 1-2 props. Controlled, dramatic light.
Luxury (Rs 5000+): Black acrylic, velvet, mirror. Zero props. Hard spotlight.

### STEP F: Select PROPS using the 3-Ring System
Ring 1 (touching product): Items physically present during use. Serum → dropper, cotton pad. Chai → steel glass, saucer. Earrings → jewelry box, small mirror.
Ring 2 (in scene): Context builders. Serum → flowers, towel. Chai → newspaper, window light. Earrings → perfume bottle, hairbrush.
Ring 3 (background, out of focus): Atmosphere. Blurred shelves, window, warm interior bokeh.

Prop count by segment: Budget 2-3, Mid 3-5, Premium 1-2, Luxury 0-1.
RULE: Props must NEVER upstage the product. The product is always brightest and sharpest.

### STEP G: LIGHTING direction
- Front-lit → safe, shows all details (e-commerce)
- Side-lit (45°) → texture and dimension (food, skincare, fabric)
- Backlit → rim glow and drama (beverages, transparent products)
- Top-lit → stable impressions (flat-lay food, jewelry top-down)

### STEP H: Apply STYLE modifiers
The user's selected style modifies the visual treatment:
- Autmn Special → YOU decide the best approach. Be bold, unexpected, scroll-stopping.
- Lifestyle → real-life setting where the product is ACTUALLY used
- Outdoor → genuine outdoor setting with natural light and elements
- Studio → colored backdrop, minimal props, clean and controlled
- Clean White → pure white, zero props, product and shadow only
- With Model → person NATURALLY interacting with the product mid-action

### STEP I: SCROLL-STOPPING elements
Include ONE unexpected element that makes someone stop scrolling:
- A mid-pour splash frozen in time
- Steam rising in dramatic light
- An ingredient floating weightlessly
- A fabric mid-flutter
- Condensation dripping at the perfect moment
- A flame reflecting in a surface

### STEP J: INDIAN MARKET awareness
- Warm tones dominate Indian visual culture (gold, amber, saffron)
- Festive elements (diyas, marigolds, rangoli) when appropriate
- Authentic settings > sterile perfection (slightly imperfect = trustworthy)
- Traditional products need heritage elements (brass, silk, wood)
- Bold compositions work better on WhatsApp/Instagram mobile screens

### CRITICAL: YOUR CREATIVE BRIEF MUST BE UNIQUE TO THIS PRODUCT
If someone sends a diet soda → design a poolside/BBQ/rooftop scene
If someone sends homemade pickle → design a dining table with roti scene
If someone sends a protein bar → design a gym/hiking scene
If someone sends bridal jewellery → design a wedding prep scene
If someone sends a candle → design a cozy evening scene with the flame as light source

NEVER use the same scene for different products. NEVER default to generic settings.
Every product has ONE perfect scene. Find it.

FOR style_with_model — A PERSON AND THE PRODUCT TOGETHER:
Show a person naturally interacting with this product in a way that makes someone want to buy it. A person must be visible with their face showing — not just hands or feet. The product must be clearly visible and recognizable. The interaction should feel natural and authentic — mid-action, not posed. Sometimes the person USING the product is the ad. Sometimes the person's LIFESTYLE with the product is the ad. You decide which approach creates a more compelling image for THIS specific product. You are a world-class creative director — figure out the best composition.

Every product has its OWN ideal scene. DO NOT recycle scenes between products.
For the style "${styleKey}", design the scene that makes THIS product's target customer stop scrolling.

### 5c: Emotional Trigger
What should the viewer FEEL? One of: craving, desire, energy, comfort, luxury, freshness, joy, confidence, warmth, power, serenity, excitement, nostalgia, sophistication, playfulness, wonder

### 5d: Story Scene
Describe what is HAPPENING in this image in 2-3 sentences. Not camera specs — the SCENE. What objects are where? What action is frozen? What's the setting?

### 5e: Creative Brief
Write a 60-100 word PRECISE scene description. Every word must earn its place. Describe the surface, the single most important prop, the light direction, and the product placement.

IMPORTANT: The product must look like a PHOTOGRAPHED physical object — NOT a 3D render. Include material cues: "packaging catches key light with specular highlights", "slight dimensional bulging from contents", "visible crinkle texture on foil/plastic", "glass surface shows reflections". The product should look premium and beautiful but REAL.

${photoSpec}

${FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES}

### 5f: Scene Prompt (40-70 words)
A concise creative ad scene description for image generation. Focus on the STORY and DYNAMIC ELEMENTS, not camera specs.

### 5g: Background-Only Prompt (40-70 words)
An EMPTY scene matching the style with NO product. "no products, no objects in center, clear negative space."

## COLD BEVERAGE RULES (apply ONLY when isColdBeverage is true):
- NEVER add steam, smoke, heat haze, or any heat-implying atmospheric effect near or around the product
- The can or bottle MUST appear COLD and CHILLED — show condensation droplets, frost, ice cubes, cold mist at the base, or frost rings on the surface beneath the can
- Do NOT place the product in a café or any setting associated with hot beverages
- Emotional trigger MUST be "energy", "freshness", "excitement", or "power" — NEVER "warmth", "comfort", or "serenity"

## RULES FOR THE CREATIVE BRIEF:

- PRODUCT-RELEVANT PROPS: The scene MUST include 2-3 props that directly relate to the product's ingredients, flavor, use case, or category.
  EXCEPTION — style_clean_white: ZERO props. Only the product on pure white.
  EXCEPTION — style_studio: Props ONLY if directly derived from the product (ingredients, flavors, materials). If nothing relevant exists, use ZERO props.

- LIGHTING LANGUAGE: Describe light as a PHYSICAL PRESENCE: "warm golden light spills across from the left", "a single beam cuts through darkness catching every edge". The image generator renders light better when described poetically, not technically.

- BRAND COLOR HARMONY: Identify the product's dominant brand colors. The scene's palette should COMPLEMENT these colors. The product should VISUALLY POP against the scene — use complementary colors for contrast.

- DYNAMIC ELEMENTS must be PRODUCT-SPECIFIC, not generic:
  * Beverage → splashes of the actual liquid color, ice cubes, condensation, the drink being poured
  * Food → ingredients floating/scattered, crumbs, steam
  * Skincare → product texture swirl, dewy droplets, flower petals matching the scent
  * Perfume → mist cloud, fragrance notes as visual elements
  * Electronics → light trails, digital particles, connectivity waves
  * Jewellery → light refractions, sparkle points, soft fabric flow
  * Candles → warm smoke wisps, melted wax drips, flame glow on surroundings
  DO NOT use generic mist/fog. Every dynamic element must connect to what the product IS.

- FORBIDDEN DYNAMIC ELEMENTS BY CATEGORY:
  * Jewellery: NO water, splashes, liquid, or moisture. Use ONLY: light refractions, sparkle points, soft fabric flow, warm glow.
  * Electronics: NO water or liquid. Use ONLY: light trails, digital particles, subtle glow effects.
  * Garments: NO water or liquid. Use ONLY: fabric motion, wind, floating threads, natural movement.
  * Candles: NO water. Use ONLY: smoke wisps, warm glow, flame reflections.
  * Bags: NO water. Use ONLY: motion blur, fabric texture, natural light.
  * Skincare: Water/dew is OK only if the product is water-based. Otherwise use: flower petals, product texture, soft glow.
  * Food/Beverage: Water, ice, splashes, condensation are all OK and encouraged.

## STEP 6: PRODUCT USAGE CONTEXT (CRITICAL FOR AD ACCURACY)

For FOOD/BEVERAGE products:
- "servingTemperature": "hot" | "cold" | "room_temperature" | "frozen" | "not_applicable"
- "consumptionMethod": HOW is it physically consumed? "eaten by hand from wrapper" vs "drunk from can"
- "typicalSetting": WHERE is this product typically consumed?
- "servingVessel": What container is it served in? Protein bar = "none, eaten from wrapper". Soup = "bowl".
- "utensils": What do you use to eat/drink it? Protein bar = "hands only". Steak = "fork and knife".
- "usageOccasion": When/why is it consumed? "post-workout snack", "morning energy boost"
- "productState": "sealed" (packaged products that should remain closed) | "open" (products shown in use) | "not_applicable" (products without packaging)

For NON-FOOD products:
- "servingTemperature": "not_applicable"
- "servingVessel": "not_applicable"
- "utensils": "not_applicable"
- "consumptionMethod": how is it used? "worn around neck", "applied to face with fingertips"
- "typicalSetting": where is it used? "vanity table getting ready", "gym locker room"
- "usageOccasion": "wedding preparation", "daily morning skincare routine"

CRITICAL MISTAKES THIS PREVENTS:
- A protein bar on a china plate with fork and knife (it's eaten from the wrapper by hand)
- Steam rising from an energy drink or ice cream (both are cold/room temperature)
- A gym protein bar in a formal restaurant setting

## STEP 7: INDIAN MARKET INTELLIGENCE (CRITICAL — prevents cultural mistakes)

### FOOD & BEVERAGE RULES:
- CHAI: Serve in kulhad (clay cup) or cutting chai glass. NEVER in a Western coffee mug. Steam is REQUIRED.
- FILTER COFFEE: Serve in davara-tumbler (South Indian steel set). NOT in a paper cup or mug.
- LASSI: Serve in tall steel glass or earthen glass. NOT in a cocktail glass.
- MITHAI/SWEETS (ladoo, barfi, halwa): Serve on brass or steel thali. NEVER on a Western ceramic plate with fork. Scatter marigold petals, not roses. Show diyas, not candles.
- PACKAGED SNACKS (chips, biscuits, protein bars): Eaten BY HAND from the wrapper/packet. NEVER on a plate with cutlery. Setting: gym, office, on-the-go. NOT formal dining.
- SPICES/MASALAS: These are INGREDIENTS, not food to eat. Show with whole spices scattered, mortar-pestle, kitchen setting. NEVER plated as a meal.
- PICKLES/CHUTNEYS: Show in jar with pairing food nearby (papad, bread, rice). Rustic, homemade aesthetic.
- HONEY: Room temperature. The honey-drip from a wooden dipper is the classic shot.

### JEWELLERY RULES:
- NECKLACES: Must be on a velvet bust/stand, on a neck, or draped on silk fabric. NEVER lying flat on a desk.
- TEMPLE/TRADITIONAL jewellery: Indian setting (silk, diyas, brass). NEVER Western luxury (champagne, roses).
- BANGLES: Always shown in SETS (never single). On a bangle stand or wrist with mehendi.
- EARRINGS: Always shown as a PAIR. On an earring stand or worn.
- NO water/condensation on jewellery EVER.

### GARMENT RULES:
- SAREES: MUST be draped/on mannequin. NEVER shown folded flat. Pallu and border must be visible.
- KURTIS: On body or hanger, showing the cut and fit.
- JUTTIS/KOLHAPURIS: Rustic Indian setting. NOT Western shoe store.

### SKINCARE RULES:
- AYURVEDIC products: Rustic, natural setting (herbs, clay, wood). NOT clinical/sterile.
- Modern serums: Clean bathroom/vanity setting.
- HAIR OIL: Warm Indian home setting. Traditional champi context.

### HOME GOODS RULES:
- CANDLES: MUST be shown LIT. Flame is the product's hero element. Indoor evening setting.
- DEITY FIGURINES: Absolute reverence. Pooja room/altar ONLY. NEVER near food/beverages or in casual settings.
- CUPS/MUGS: Show WITH beverage inside. Kulhad = chai only. Mug = coffee.
- WALL ART: On a wall in a room. NEVER flat on a table.

### UNIVERSAL ANTI-PATTERNS (NEVER DO THESE):
1. Fork and knife with Indian food that is eaten by hand
2. Steam on room-temperature food (protein bars, biscuits, packaged snacks)
3. Ice/condensation on non-cold products
4. Chai in a coffee mug
5. Single bangle (always sets), single earring (always pairs)
6. Saree shown folded flat
7. Unlit candle
8. Deity items in casual/disrespectful settings
9. Homemade/artisanal products in sterile clinical settings
10. Water/moisture on jewellery, electronics, or paper products

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT FOR CREATIVE BRIEF: The creative brief must NEVER describe the product differently from how it appears in the input photo. Do not invent details, simplify the product, or change its design. The brief should describe the SCENE and ENVIRONMENT around the product, not redesign the product itself.
- CONDENSATION/WATER DROPLETS: Only add condensation or water droplets if the product is a BEVERAGE CONTAINER or FOOD/DRINK product. For ALL other categories, the product surface must remain DRY.
- EXACTLY ONE product in the image — NEVER duplicate or clone
- Product is the HERO — fills the recommended canvas percentage
- Product MUST obey gravity
- Product matches original photo EXACTLY — same shape, colors, text, logos
- The image is EDGE TO EDGE — NO borders, frames, picture-frame effects, or decorative edges
- Do NOT add ANY text, watermarks, labels, or attribution text ANYWHERE
- No illustrated or cartoon elements — everything is photorealistic
- Include natural photographic imperfections: "subtle film grain at full resolution", "dust motes in rim light", "slight vignetting at edges"
- Frame as describing a photograph that ALREADY EXISTS
- End with: "Square format, 1:1 aspect ratio."
- CRITICAL PERSON RULE:
  - If style is "style_with_model": MUST include exactly ONE Indian/South Asian person. Show a person naturally interacting with this product — their face must be visible, not just hands or feet. The product must be clearly visible and recognizable. The interaction should feel authentic and mid-action, not posed. Describe their age, gender, expression, clothing, skin tone. Realistic features: visible pores, asymmetric candid smile, flyaway hair strands. You decide the best composition for THIS specific product.
  - For ALL other styles: ZERO people, ZERO hands, ZERO body parts, ZERO mannequins.

  if (voiceInstructions && voiceInstructions.trim().length > 0) {
    const sanitized = voiceInstructions
      .trim()

    prompt += `## USER'S CREATIVE DIRECTION
"${sanitized}"

Integrate this into your creative concept for the chosen style. IMPORTANT RULES:
- PRODUCT INTEGRITY IS SACRED: Color, setting, and mood instructions apply ONLY to the SCENE and ENVIRONMENT — NEVER to the product itself. The product's every physical attribute (colors, materials, strap color, case finish, fabric shade, label design, packaging color) must remain EXACTLY as in the input photo. Only modify the product's appearance if the user EXPLICITLY names a specific product part to change.
- If the user mentions a COLOR (e.g., "red background"), use that color as the DOMINANT TONE woven throughout the scene in lighting, props, surfaces, atmosphere. Do NOT make a flat solid-color background. Create a rich, styled scene where that color PERMEATES the environment naturally.
- If the user mentions a SETTING (e.g., "garden", "kitchen", "beach"), design the scene IN that setting while maintaining the chosen style's photography approach.
- If the user mentions a MOOD or EFFECT (e.g., "dramatic", "festive", "luxury"), amplify that feeling through lighting, composition, and props.
- INDIAN FESTIVAL INTELLIGENCE: Different Indian festivals have VERY DIFFERENT visual identities. Do NOT mix them:
  * DIWALI: Oil lamps (diyas), string lights, firecrackers, rangoli, sparklers, indoor glittering settings
  * CHHATH PUJA: River/ghat setting at sunset or sunrise, bamboo soop, sugarcane stalks, thekua sweets, fruits, brass vessels with offerings, banana leaves. NO diyas, NO string lights. The setting is ALWAYS at a riverbank.
  * HOLI: Colored powders (gulal), water colors, pichkari (water guns), white clothes splashed with color, playful energy
  * NAVRATRI/DURGA PUJA: Red and gold colors, dandiya sticks, traditional garba dress
  * MAKAR SANKRANTI: Kites, sesame-jaggery sweets (tilgul), open sky settings
  * EID: Crescent moon, dates, biryani, traditional Islamic patterns, green and white colors
  * CHRISTMAS: Decorated tree, red-green-gold colors, stars, gifts, winter elements
  If the user mentions a specific festival, use ONLY that festival's visual elements.
