Hard directional light from above-left creating intense specular highlights on every metallic element — zippers, buckles, clasps, rivets, chain links. The navy darkness makes the metal glow like jewelry. The bag looks expensive, the hardware looks precious. Premium, detail-obsessed, luxurious.`,
      `PINK EDITORIAL. Techniques: DUSTY PINK BACKDROP + FASHION MAGAZINE PROP + STUDIO RIM LIGHT. Dusty pink seamless paper. The bag placed beside an open fashion magazine (blurred pages) and a pair of sunglasses as styling props. Studio rim light from behind creating edge separation. The pink backdrop creates a feminine, editorial fashion shoot feel. Stylish, curated, magazine-worthy.`,
      `CHARCOAL SHADOW. Techniques: CHARCOAL BACKDROP + DRAMATIC SHADOW PLAY + SINGLE OVERHEAD SPOT. Dark charcoal seamless paper. Single overhead spot creating a focused cone of light on the bag with a dramatic, elongated shadow stretching across the dark surface. Minimal styling — the bag and its shadow are the entire composition. The shadow adds visual weight and drama. Architectural, bold, statement-making.`,

    default: [
      `TEAL CAMPAIGN. Techniques: DEEP TEAL BACKDROP + COMPLEMENTARY PROP + HARD KEY LIGHT. Deep teal seamless paper creating maximum contrast with the product. One complementary prop at the base telling the product's story. Hard key light from 45° left creating a dramatic shadow cast on the teal surface. The cool teal makes warm product tones pop. Bold, professional, campaign-ready.`,
      `TERRACOTTA WARMTH. Techniques: WARM TERRACOTTA BACKDROP + NATURAL TEXTURE ACCENT + GOLDEN SIDE LIGHT. Warm terracotta/clay seamless paper. A natural texture accent near the base — a linen fold, a wooden element, a ceramic piece. Golden side light from the right at 3800K creating warm dimensional shadows. The earthy tones communicate authenticity and craft. Warm, grounded, artisanal.`,
      `SAGE STUDIO. Techniques: DUSTY SAGE BACKDROP + SINGLE CONTEXTUAL PROP + SOFT DIRECTIONAL LIGHT. Dusty sage green seamless paper. One single contextual prop that relates to the product's use or story. Soft directional studio light from front-left creating gentle, clean shadows. The muted green provides a calm, sophisticated canvas. Refined, intentional, modern.`,
      `NAVY ACCENT. Techniques: RICH NAVY BACKDROP + METALLIC ACCENT ELEMENT + DUAL STUDIO LIGHTING. Rich navy seamless paper. A small metallic accent element — brass dish, copper tray, gold-toned object — beside the product. Dual studio lighting: warm key from left, cool fill from right creating chromatic depth. The navy-metallic combination feels premium and editorial. Elevated, luxurious, polished.`,
      `BLUSH SHADOW. Techniques: WARM BLUSH BACKDROP + MINIMAL STYLING + DRAMATIC SHADOW PLAY. Warm blush/salmon seamless paper. Zero props — the product stands alone. Hard studio light creating a dramatic shadow of the product stretching across the blush surface. The shadow becomes the primary compositional element. The warmth of the blush adds approachability to the drama. Clean, bold, graphic.`,

  style_minimal: {
    default: [
      `ARCHITECTURAL STILLNESS. Techniques: SINGLE DIRECTIONAL LIGHT + DRAMATIC SHADOW + NEGATIVE SPACE. One hard light source from 60-80° creating a long, geometric shadow that IS the primary compositional element — the shadow is as important as the product itself. Product on raw concrete or honed stone. 60-70% of the frame is intentional empty space creating visual tension. Rule-of-thirds placement at the intersection. NO props, NO people, NO hands. The interplay of form, shadow, and void creates an architectural meditation. Zen, sophisticated, gallery-worthy.`,

## EXAMPLES OF SCROLL-STOPPING CREATIVE CONCEPTS

Example 1 — Masala Chips Pack (style_gradient — INGREDIENT EXPLOSION):
{
  "heroMoment": "The explosive burst of spice and crunch when you rip open a fresh pack",
  "dynamicElements": ["chips and spice particles EXPLODING outward from the pack in a halo", "red chili powder cloud suspended mid-air", "one chip frozen mid-flight showing seasoning crystals catching rim light", "crushed peanuts and curry leaves scattered at the base"],
  "emotionalTrigger": "craving",
  "storyScene": "Pitch black background. The masala chips pack stands on polished black acrylic, its surface reflecting below. An EXPLOSION of chips, chili powder, curry leaves, and peanut fragments erupts outward from the opened top — each chip frozen mid-flight, each spice particle caught in the dual rim lights. Red chili powder forms a dramatic cloud around the pack. The label is sharply lit and legible.",
  "creativeBrief": "Editorial product advertisement. Against total darkness, the masala chips pack stands center-frame on wet black acrylic, its mirror reflection visible below. Two strip softbox rim lights from behind-left and behind-right create razor-sharp glowing edges on the metallic packaging. From the torn-open top, an explosion of chips, red chili powder, crushed peanuts, and curry leaves erupts outward in a frozen burst — each element suspended mid-air, lit by the rim lights. Individual chili powder particles form a red-orange cloud around the upper half of the pack. One large chip is frozen at the peak of its arc, its seasoning crystals catching individual specks of light. At the base, scattered curry leaves and peanut fragments rest on the wet black surface among the reflection. Hard key light from front-left at 45° illuminates the pack label. The acrylic surface shows authentic wet sheen. Subtle film grain. Square format, 1:1 aspect ratio."
}

Example 2 — Energy Drink Can (style_gradient — SPLASH + ICE):
{
  "heroMoment": "The adrenaline rush of ice-cold energy exploding in your hand",
  "dynamicElements": ["massive water and ice splash erupting from behind the can", "ice chunks and shards frozen mid-explosion at the base", "condensation droplets beading on the can surface", "low-lying cold mist rolling across the dark surface", "colored accent rim light matching the can's flavor color"],
  "emotionalTrigger": "energy",
  "storyScene": "Pure black void. The energy can sits on wet black obsidian. A violent explosion of water, crushed ice, and ice shards erupts from behind and around the can, frozen at its peak. The can is covered in beaded condensation. Cold mist rolls at the base. Dual rim lights from behind — one matching the can's brand color (green, orange, or blue), the other cool white — create a chromatic glow on every water droplet.",
  "creativeBrief": "Editorial product advertisement. Against pure black, the energy can stands on polished black obsidian with its reflection visible below. Behind the can, a massive crown-shaped splash of water and crushed ice erupts upward and outward, frozen at 1/8000s — individual droplets razor-sharp against the darkness. Two strip softbox rim lights: one in the can's brand accent color, one cool white, create dual-colored edges on every surface. Ice chunks and shards scatter at the base, some caught mid-bounce. The can surface is covered in beaded condensation, each droplet acting as a tiny lens. Low-lying cold mist rolls across the obsidian surface. The can label is sharply legible, illuminated by a subtle warm key from front-left. The wet surface reflects the chaos of the splash. Subtle vignetting at edges. Square format, 1:1 aspect ratio."
}

Example 3 — Diamond Necklace (style_festive — DIYA GLOW):
{
  "heroMoment": "The auspicious radiance of precious jewelry lit by sacred flames",
  "dynamicElements": ["lit diyas creating warm pools of golden light from multiple points", "each gemstone refracting a different color of firelight", "scattered marigold petals catching the warm glow", "fine kumkum dust particles floating in the diya light"],
  "emotionalTrigger": "desire",
  "storyScene": "A brass thali on red velvet. The diamond necklace is arranged in a horseshoe arc, flanked by two lit brass diyas whose flames create the primary warm lighting. Marigold petals scattered around. Gold coins at the edges. Each diamond catches the diya firelight at a different angle, creating multiple sparkle points. Fine kumkum particles float in the warm air. Golden fairy light bokeh at three depths behind. NO person, NO hands.",
  "creativeBrief": "Editorial product advertisement. On deep red velvet draped over a brass thali, the diamond necklace is arranged in an elegant arc. Two lit brass diyas flank the piece — their 2700K flames are the primary light source, creating warm golden pools that illuminate the gems. Each diamond facet catches the flickering firelight at a unique angle — some producing white fire, others warm amber. Matching earrings placed symmetrically below. Scattered marigold petals and gold coins at the edges catch individual specks of firelight. Fine kumkum dust particles are visible in the warm air. Behind, golden fairy light bokeh circles at three different depths create layered warmth. The red velvet shows its pile texture. Subtle film grain. NO person, NO hands, NO body parts. Square format, 1:1 aspect ratio."
}

Example 4 — Face Serum Bottle (style_lifestyle — TEXTURE + BOTANICAL):
{
  "heroMoment": "The glowing, dewy-skin promise of a perfect morning skincare ritual",
  "dynamicElements": ["serum drop caught mid-fall from the dropper, backlit like liquid gold", "fresh-cut citrus and botanical ingredients arranged around with visible dew", "product swatch smeared on a glass surface showing translucent gel texture"],
  "emotionalTrigger": "freshness",
  "storyScene": "A marble bathroom vanity in soft morning light. The serum bottle stands with its dropper lifted, a single golden drop caught mid-fall, backlit. Around the base: a halved orange, fresh aloe leaf, rosemary sprig — all misted with water droplets looking fresh-picked. A smear of the serum on the marble surface catches light, showing its gel consistency. Warm directional light from a window on the left.",
  "creativeBrief": "Editorial product advertisement. On a white marble vanity surface, the face serum bottle stands slightly left of center. The glass dropper is lifted above the bottle — a single luminous drop of golden serum is caught mid-fall, backlit by soft 4000K window light from the left that makes it glow like liquid amber. Around the bottle base: a halved blood orange, a fresh-cut aloe leaf showing its gel interior, and a rosemary sprig — all misted with fine water droplets that catch individual specks of light. On the marble surface near the bottle, a small swatch of serum is smeared, showing its translucent gel texture. The marble shows natural veining. A small white ceramic dish and folded linen towel provide context. Shot on Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4, shallow DOF with the bathroom blurred into soft warm tones. Square format, 1:1 aspect ratio."
}

Example 5 — Kurti/Ethnic Dress (style_studio — FABRIC MOTION + COLOR):
{
  "heroMoment": "The flowing elegance of fabric that makes you feel beautiful",
  "dynamicElements": ["fabric edge caught mid-flow as if a gentle breeze just passed", "deep teal backdrop chosen for maximum complementary contrast against warm gold/red embroidery", "dramatic shadow of the garment cast on the colored surface", "embroidery thread catching specular highlights"],
  "emotionalTrigger": "confidence",
  "storyScene": "A deep teal seamless paper backdrop. Deep teal was chosen because the kurti's warm embroidery (gold/red) creates maximum complementary contrast against cool teal. The embroidered kurti is displayed on an invisible form, its fabric edge caught mid-ripple as if touched by wind. The garment's embroidery details catch the hard key light. A dramatic shadow of the garment falls on the teal surface, creating a second compositional element. One small prop at the base: a pair of jhumka earrings.",
  "creativeBrief": "Editorial product advertisement. Against a rich deep teal seamless paper backdrop — chosen specifically because the kurti's warm gold and red embroidery creates maximum complementary contrast against the cool teal. The embroidered kurti is displayed showing its full silhouette. The fabric's bottom edge is caught mid-ripple, creating dynamic movement. Hard key light from 45° front-left at 5500K creates a dramatic shadow of the garment on the teal surface — the shadow becomes a compositional element, stretching to the right. Fill light from a reflector at 3:1 ratio preserves embroidery detail in the shadows. Each gold embroidery thread catches specular highlights, creating a constellation of tiny light points across the fabric. At the base, a pair of brass jhumka earrings provides scale and cultural context. The teal-gold contrast is the creative strategy — warm product on cool backdrop for maximum visual impact. Shot on Hasselblad X2D 100C, 90mm f/3.2 for razor-sharp textile detail. Square format, 1:1 aspect ratio."
}

Example 6 — Ceramic Vase (style_minimal — ARCHITECTURAL SHADOW):
{
  "heroMoment": "The meditative beauty of a single object and its shadow in perfect balance",
  "dynamicElements": ["long geometric shadow stretching across raw concrete surface", "60% intentional negative space creating visual tension", "single hard light source from 70° creating sharp shadow edges"],
  "emotionalTrigger": "serenity",
  "storyScene": "A raw honed concrete surface. The ceramic vase is placed at the right-third intersection, occupying only 35% of the frame. A single hard light from 70° left creates a long, dramatic shadow stretching diagonally across the empty concrete — the shadow is as important as the object itself. No props. No decoration. The vast empty space and the shadow create an architectural meditation.",
  "creativeBrief": "Editorial product advertisement. On a raw honed concrete surface with subtle aggregate visible, the ceramic vase sits at the right-third intersection point. A single hard directional light source from 70° left at 5000K neutral creates a long, razor-sharp geometric shadow that stretches diagonally across the concrete to the bottom-left corner — the shadow occupies more visual space than the product itself and IS the primary compositional element. 60-65% of the frame is intentional empty concrete, creating deliberate tension between object and void. The vase's curved form is rendered in clean side-lit dimension — highlight on the left face, gradual shadow transition to the right. The concrete shows micro-texture and natural variation. No props, no color accents, no distractions. The interplay of form, shadow, and negative space creates gallery-worthy stillness. Subtle film grain at full resolution. Shot on Hasselblad X2D 100C, 90mm f/3.2, ISO 64. Square format, 1:1 aspect ratio."
}

Example 7 — Eau de Parfum Bottle (style_with_model — PERSON USING PRODUCT):
{
  "heroMoment": "The intoxicating confidence of a final spritz before stepping out for the evening",
  "dynamicElements": ["mist of perfume frozen mid-spray catching the warm light", "person's eyes closed savoring the fragrance", "dresser mirror reflecting the scene from a second angle"],
  "emotionalTrigger": "confidence",
  "storyScene": "An Indian man in a fitted charcoal shirt stands at a bedroom dresser. He holds the perfume bottle in his right hand, spraying it on his left wrist — the fine mist is frozen mid-spray, catching warm side-light. His eyes are closed, chin slightly lifted, savoring the scent. The perfume bottle label is clearly visible. Behind him, a dresser mirror reflects the bottle from another angle. Warm evening light from a lamp.",
  "creativeBrief": "Editorial product advertisement. An Indian man in a charcoal linen shirt at a bedroom dresser, spraying the Eau de Parfum on his left wrist. Fine perfume mist frozen mid-spray catches warm 3200K lamp light from the right. His eyes are closed, chin slightly raised, savoring the fragrance. The bottle label faces camera, clearly legible. Dresser mirror behind reflects the scene. Warm amber tones throughout. Shot on Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4, shallow DOF blurring the bedroom. Square format, 1:1 aspect ratio."
}

Example 8 — Wireless Earbuds Case (style_gradient — NEON ACCENT):
{
  "heroMoment": "The futuristic power of technology that feels like it's from another era",
  "dynamicElements": ["neon cyan accent rim light creating electric blue edges against total darkness", "low-lying fog rolling across the reflective black surface", "product's LED indicator glowing as a secondary light source", "floating dust particles caught in the neon light beam"],
  "emotionalTrigger": "power",
  "storyScene": "Pure black void. The earbuds case sits on polished black obsidian with its mirror reflection below. A neon cyan rim light from behind-right wraps every edge in electric blue. Low fog rolls at the base, caught in the glow. The case's LED indicator pulses as a secondary warm light point. Fine particles float in the cyan beam. The product looks like it costs 10x its price.",
  "creativeBrief": "Editorial product advertisement. Against pure black, the wireless earbuds charging case sits center-frame on polished black obsidian, its full mirror reflection visible below in the dark surface. A neon cyan accent rim light from behind-right at 6500K creates razor-sharp electric blue edges along every contour of the case — the glow wraps around the curved surfaces creating a futuristic luminous outline. From behind-left, a subtle cool white strip softbox provides secondary edge definition. Low-lying fog rolls across the obsidian surface at the base, the fog itself catching and diffusing the cyan light into a soft ground-level glow. The case's small LED status indicator glows warm amber, creating a tiny secondary light source that reflects in the obsidian below. Fine dust particles float in the cyan light beam, visible as tiny bright points against the void. The case surface shows authentic material texture — matte plastic with subtle sheen where the light catches. The obsidian surface has a wet, mirror-like quality. Subtle vignetting at edges pulls focus to center. Shot on Sony A7 IV, 50mm f/1.2, ISO 400. Square format, 1:1 aspect ratio."

Do NOT override this style based on product type. The user chose this style explicitly.

## STEP 1: Input Quality Assessment
- Is this photo usable? Reject only if: no product visible, extremely blurry (<100px), corrupted
- Accept messy backgrounds, poor lighting, bad angles — we fix everything
- "hasGlare": true if visible specular reflections or flash hotspots on product
- "inputAngleQuality": "good"/"suboptimal"/"unusable"

## STEP 2: Product Identification (be EXTREMELY specific)
Full brand name, product type, variant, size. NOT "speaker" but "Anker SoundCore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker, black mesh front, ANKER logo on face."
- productComponents: List EVERY visible physical sub-component of the product (cap, lid, straw, cable, stand, box, tag, applicator, tube, wrapper). Be exhaustive — if you can see it, list it.
- "isColdBeverage": Set to true if the product is ANY beverage that is served cold or at room temperature — this includes energy drink cans, soda cans, cola, sparkling water, juice bottles, water bottles, beer cans/bottles, sports drinks, iced tea, cold coffee cans, kombucha. Set to false for all non-beverages and for hot beverages (coffee sachets, tea bags, instant mixes meant to be made hot). When in doubt about whether it is a cold beverage, set to true.

## STEP 2.5: Physical Characteristics
- "productPhysicalSize": "tiny" (palm-sized) | "small" (hand-sized) | "medium" (forearm-sized) | "large" (bigger)
- "productDimensionality": "flat_2d" | "shallow_3d" | "deep_3d"
- "recommendedCanvasFill": 0.3-0.95 (tiny+flat=0.85, large=0.60)

## STEP 3: Branding Detection
- "hasBranding": true if ANY brand text/logo/mark visible
- "brandingConfidence": 0.0-1.0 (when uncertain, err HIGH — better to preserve than destroy)
- "brandElements": list every visible brand element

## STEP 4: Full Product Analysis
Deep analysis: colors, materials, textures, target audience, price segment, scene, ad best practices.

## STEP 5: CREATIVE CONCEPT (THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP)

You are now the creative director. Your job is to design an advertisement that makes people WANT this product.

### 5a: Hero Moment
What single EMOTIONAL MOMENT should this ad capture? Not "product on a nice background" but a specific human moment that triggers desire. Examples: "the first sip of ice-cold lemonade on a hot day", "the satisfaction of biting into a warm cookie", "the quiet confidence of clasping on a precious necklace."

### 5b: Dynamic Elements
What specific MOTION, TEXTURE, or ACTION elements make this ad come alive? These are the details that separate a boring product photo from a COMPELLING advertisement. Examples: water splashes, crumbs scattered, steam rising, condensation droplets, ingredients mid-fall, fabric draping, sparkle on gems, smoke wisps, liquid pouring.

The style is FIXED as ${styleKey}. You MUST use ONLY these elements — do NOT invent a different setting or context.
IMPORTANT: If the product is a cold beverage (isColdBeverage = true), you MUST use the BEVERAGE_COLD narrative instead of the DEFAULT narrative:
${narrativeEntries}

### 5c: Emotional Trigger
What should the viewer FEEL? One of: craving, desire, energy, comfort, luxury, freshness, joy, confidence, warmth, power, serenity, excitement, nostalgia, sophistication, playfulness, wonder

### 5d: Story Scene
Describe what is HAPPENING in this image in 2-3 sentences. Not camera specs — the SCENE. What objects are where? What action is frozen? What's the setting?

### 5e: Creative Brief
Write a 120-180 word VIVID scene description for the AI image generator. Start with "Editorial product advertisement." then describe the physical scene: surface, product position, dynamic elements, lighting direction and color temperature, lens/DOF. Be SPECIFIC about what is WHERE — not flowery prose. This goes directly to the image generator.

IMPORTANT: The product must look like a PHOTOGRAPHED physical object — NOT a 3D render. Include material cues in the brief: "packaging catches key light with specular highlights", "slight dimensional bulging from contents", "visible crinkle texture on foil/plastic", "glass surface shows reflections", "metal has natural sheen". The product should look premium and beautiful but REAL — like a high-end photoshoot, not a CGI illustration.

${photoSpec}

${FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES}

### 5f: Scene Prompt (40-70 words)
A concise creative ad scene description for image generation. Focus on the STORY and DYNAMIC ELEMENTS, not camera specs.

### 5g: Background-Only Prompt (40-70 words)
An EMPTY scene matching the style with NO product. "no products, no objects in center, clear negative space."

## COLD BEVERAGE RULES (apply ONLY when isColdBeverage is true):
If this product is a cold beverage (isColdBeverage = true), ALL of the following are MANDATORY in every generated field (heroMoment, dynamicElements, storyScene, creativeBrief):
- NEVER add steam, smoke, heat haze, or any heat-implying atmospheric effect near or around the product
- The can or bottle MUST appear COLD and CHILLED — show condensation droplets, frost, ice cubes, cold mist at the base, or frost rings on the surface beneath the can
- Do NOT place the product in a café, coffee shop, or any setting associated with hot beverages
- Do NOT use props that suggest hot beverages (coffee cups, teapots, chai glasses, mugs of steaming liquid)
- For style_with_model: the model's expression and pose MUST convey ENERGY and VITALITY — wide alert eyes, dynamic posture, energized expression. NOT serene, meditative, or savoring-like-tea. Think: "just cracked open, ready to go" not "slowly sipping warm tea"
- For style_lifestyle and style_gradient: use cold-environment props (ice, condensation, gym gear, outdoor urban settings, earbuds, towels, workout accessories) instead of warm home/café props
- The emotional trigger MUST be "energy", "freshness", "excitement", or "power" — NEVER "warmth", "comfort", or "serenity"

## RULES FOR THE CREATIVE BRIEF:
- EXACTLY ONE product in the image — NEVER duplicate or clone
- Product is the HERO — fills the recommended canvas percentage
- Product MUST obey gravity (lies flat, leans, or stands on base)
- Product matches original photo EXACTLY — same shape, colors, text, logos
- The image is EDGE TO EDGE — NO borders, frames, picture-frame effects, or decorative edges anywhere
- Do NOT add ANY text, watermarks, labels, attribution text, "AI Generated" text, or copyright notices ANYWHERE
- No illustrated or cartoon elements — everything is photorealistic
- Include natural photographic imperfections: "subtle film grain at full resolution", "dust motes in rim light", "slight vignetting at edges", "surfaces show micro-texture and real-world wear"
- Frame as describing a photograph that ALREADY EXISTS
- End with: "Square format, 1:1 aspect ratio."
- CRITICAL PERSON RULE:
  - If style is "style_with_model": You MUST include exactly ONE Indian person actively interacting with the product. This is MANDATORY — the creative brief, story scene, and hero moment MUST describe a person using/wearing/holding the product. Describe their age, gender, expression, clothing, skin tone, and how they interact with the product. Realistic features: visible pores, asymmetric candid smile, flyaway hair strands. Grip matches product size/weight.
  - For ALL other styles (style_studio, style_gradient, style_lifestyle, style_outdoor, style_festive, style_clean_white, style_minimal): ZERO people, ZERO hands, ZERO body parts, ZERO mannequins. The product sits on a surface or in an environment — NEVER on a person.
